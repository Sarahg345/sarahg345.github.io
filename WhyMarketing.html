	<center><P> I am currently attending the University of Maine as a marketing major and am eventually hoping to get a career in that field. While I was in high school, I participated in DECA and took two years of Marketing through the technical school. While in those programs, I competed in both state and national level competitions with advertising campaigns created by me and a partner. At states I took home first place both my junior and senior year, and was lucky enough to go to Anaheim, California during April of my senior year to compete against 18,000 others in Nationals. Though I did not take home any big trophies, I had an amazing experience and got to be a part of many ceremonies and activities that I learned a lot from. Through those two years of DECA and Marketing, I realized I wanted to continue learning more in college. Once I graduate from college, my dream is to end up working for a successful company with a marketing related job (I haven't quite figured out the specific area of marketing that I want to pursue). I will hopefully be able to get an internship after freshman or sophomore year of college to gain some experience doing hands on marketing, resulting in having more knowledge for my future career, and figuring out where I would like to be in the future.</P></center>
